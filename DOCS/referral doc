Example UI Logic:
User visits product page.
Frontend calls backend:
“Get my affiliate link for this product.”
Backend:
If link exists, return the affiliate link object (with slug).
If not, return null.
Frontend:
If link exists, show “Share Link” button with the constructed URL.
If not, show “Generate Link” button.
