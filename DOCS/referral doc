Great idea! To handle this professionally and flexibly, you should:
1. Add Referral Percentage and Payment Count to the User Model
referralPercentage: Store the commission percentage for referrals (e.g., 5%).
referralPaymentCount: Store how many times a referrer can earn commission from a referred user (e.g., 1, 2, 3, or unlimited).
2. Data Types and Defaults
referralPercentage: Use a Float (or Int if you want only whole numbers), with a sensible default (e.g., 5).
referralPaymentCount: Use an Int for the count, and a special value (e.g., -1 or null) for unlimited.
3. Where to Store These Fields
If every user can have their own settings, add these fields to the User model.
If these are global settings, create a ReferralSetting model (recommended for flexibility).
4. Example Prisma Schema Changes
Option A: Per-User Settings (add to User model)

model User {
  // ... existing code ...
  referralPercentage   Float? @default(5)
  referralPaymentCount Int?   @default(1) // -1 or null for unlimited
  // ... existing code ...
}

Option B: Global Settings (recommended)

model ReferralSetting {
  id                    String   @id @default(cuid())
  referralPercentage    Float    @default(5)
  referralPaymentCount  Int      @default(1) // -1 or null for unlimited
  createdAt             DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt             DateTime @updatedAt
}

You can then fetch this setting in your business logic.
5. Business Logic
When a referred user makes a purchase, check how many times the referrer has already received a commission for this user.
If the count is less than referralPaymentCount (or unlimited), award the commission.
6. Professional Touches
Use enums for special values if you want (e.g., UNLIMITED).
Document the logic in your codebase.
Add admin controls to update these settings.
Summary:
For maximum flexibility and professionalism, use a ReferralSetting model for global settings, or add fields to the User model for per-user customization. Use a Float for percentage and an Int for count, with a special value for unlimited. Implement logic to track and enforce the payment count.
Would you like to proceed with the global settings model, per-user settings, or both?

Yes, you can absolutely use only the global referral settings without changing anything else in your schema or code!
How it works:
The per-user fields (referralPercentage and referralPaymentCount in the User model) are nullable.
If you do not set these fields for a user (i.e., they remain null), your business logic should simply fall back to the global settings in the ReferralSetting model.
You do not need to change or remove anything from your schema to use only the global settings.
In practice:
When calculating referral commission, always check the user's fields:
If user.referralPercentage is null, use ReferralSetting.referralPercentage.
If user.referralPaymentCount is null, use ReferralSetting.referralPaymentCount.
You only need to:
Create and manage a single ReferralSetting record (the global config).
Ignore the per-user fields unless you want to override for a specific user in the future.
Summary:
You can use only the global settings and ignore the per-user fields. The schema is flexible for future needs, but you are not required to use the per-user overrides.
